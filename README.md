# openai-playground
The goal of this playground is to share how we can interact with OpenAI's GPT Models, leveraging OpenAI Python library which provides convenient access to the OpenAI REST API from any Python 3.7+ applicationsome.

## Prerequisites
 - Install Visual Studio Code, following the documentation from [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows)

 - Install Python 3.7.1 or later version if you donâ€™t have installed, from [here](https://github.com/openai/openai-quickstart-python)

 - Install Jupyter Notebook, following the [Jupyter Notebooks in VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks) article.
 
 - Recommendation is to install a new python environment so it is isolated for OpenAI library, the python application can run in this environment. There there are few different ways you can create the virtual environments. [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/stable/commands/create.html) is the tool is I mostly use for Data Science environment creation, I am using virtualenv tool ([reference](https://learnpython.com/blog/how-to-use-virtualenv-python/)), running the command from the command prompt. 
     
     `
      virtualenv -p python3 myopenenv
     `
     
     `
      source myopenenv/bin/activate
     `
 - Another tool to use is [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html). An example is below:
    `
      python -m venv myopenenv
     `
     
     `
      source myopenenv/bin/activate
     `
 - The following Python libraries: os, requests, json
 - Install OpenAI client library
 
    `pip install openai`
    
    `
     pip install --upgrade openai (if you would like to upgrade to the latest)
    ` 
 - If you would like to use .env file to load the environment information from
 
   `
   pip install python-dotenv
   `
 - Create an environment variables file
 
   In VSCode, create new file called .env. I already have one environment file created. You can copy it and add your own environment variables if needed.
